## Project:
This web application is a calculator used to calculate the amount to be tipped in restaurants and other places.

The application has an easy-to-understand interface, with a form where the user must enter the total amount of the bill, what was the quality of the service (the percentage related to the tip is linked to this aspect) and how many people will share the bill. After entering the data, the application returns to the user what will be the total amount to be paid as a tip and will also inform the amount to be paid by each person (in case the bill is divided to more than 1 person).

## Other aspects:
In the development of the project, special attention was given to the correct application of semantics in its HTML structure.
In addition, I also developed media queries to adapt the application responsively to different screens and devices.

## Next steps:
> The next step that I have planned to implement in this application are improvements related to accessibility, as it is very important that it can be used properly by everyone! <br><br>
> I'll translate the application to english, it means, the title, headings, classes' name, etc. <br><br>
> It's missing the favicon image.
